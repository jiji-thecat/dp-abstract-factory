# Design Pattern - Abstract Factory Pattern

## Description

![abstract factory](https://github.com/jiji-thecat/dp-abstract-factory/assets/104809324/6d57cbeb-71fc-49a2-972d-3b728f1ed3b9)

The Abstract Factory pattern is a design pattern that provides a way to create families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes. This ensures that a set of objects requiring consistency are correctly generated.

The client class will use the `ConcreteFactory` class, which inherits from the `AbstractFactory` class.

This app generates various kinds of salads. Currently, only two salads are supported. Each salad has its own class (`ConcreteFactory` class) that inherits from the `Factory` class (`AbstractFactory` class).

## Difference between Factory Method Pattern and Abstract Factory Pattern

The Factory Method pattern enables a subclass to generate instances flexibly, thus enhancing the reusability of the class. On the other hand, the Abstract Factory pattern generates a class whose sole purpose is to create instances, ensuring that instances are always generated correctly.

Additionally, the Factory Method pattern has a class-level relationship, while the Abstract Factory pattern has an object-level relationship.
